## Introduction
This repo serves as a playground for me to poke around with AWS free-tier resources. I plan on hosting an updated version of my college project [Pearâ€”the Discord User Pairing Bot](https://github.com/kngatineau/pear_discord_bot) on the EC2 instance for private access. 

A free-version Puppet repo will eventually be in the works to manage the configuration on the instance(s) for all things Pear. Stay tuned!
