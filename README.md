## Introduction
This repo serves as a playground for me to poke around with AWS free-tier resources. I plan on hosting an updated version of my college project [Pearâ€”the Discord User Pairing Bot](https://github.com/kngatineau/pear_discord_bot) on the EC2 instance for private access.

See the `tf/` [README file](https://github.com/kngatineau/terraform-aws/blob/main/tf/README.md) for more information on the code itself.
