### Introduction
This repository is currently a playground for keeping my Terraform skills sharp while I search for employment. The goal is to poke around with as many free-tier eligible resources I can, and eventually host a small CI/CD pipeline for fun. Usually I would keep repos like this private until they're a bit more polished, but what fun is seeing a finished product when you can enjoy the process with me? :D

TODO - write instrunctions on how to recreate this infrastructure on another machine.
